# Depression-Level-Prediction

The experiment was conducted
using a Google survey form. This method effectively captures the ambiguity and imprecision in
depression evaluation by combining linguistic elements of psychological traits. Using the Pearson
correlation and R-squared methods, 15 features were chosen from 30 features, followed by five
membership functions (poor, mediocre, average, decent, and good) and fuzzy rules to evaluate and
create accurate forecasts of depression severity. Our proposed architecture can correctly classify
depression levels based on human activities and feelings with 94% accuracy using a less sophisticated
rules dictionary than previous pre-trained or hybrid models.
